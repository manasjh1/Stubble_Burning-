# 🌿 Stubble Burning Detection System 🔥

## 📌 Overview
Stubble burning is a major cause of air pollution in North India, particularly in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. Farmers burn crop residue due to limited alternatives, releasing harmful pollutants like **PM2.5, CO₂, and NOx**, which degrade air quality and pose serious health risks. The **Stubble Burning Detection System** by **AeroToxs** is an AI-powered solution that leverages satellite imagery for **real-time fire detection** and **alert generation**. 🚀

## ✨ Features
✅ **AI-powered fire detection** using satellite imagery (MODIS, VIIRS, Sentinel-3, INSAT 3D & 3DR)  
✅ **Real-time alert system** with GIS mapping, notifications via email, SMS, and API integration  
✅ **Machine learning models** trained on labeled datasets (2000-2025) for fire classification  
✅ **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for accurate fire detection  
✅ **Pre-processing techniques** using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Python  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- 🌍 **Data Sources:** NASA FIRMS, Sentinel-3, INSAT 3D & 3DR  
- 🤖 **AI/ML Frameworks:** TensorFlow, OpenCV, Python  
- 📊 **Model Training:** CNN-based deep learning models trained on historical fire data  
- 🔔 **Alert System:** API integration for notifications via SMS, email  

## 🚀 How It Works
1️⃣ **Data Acquisition** - The system collects satellite data at regular intervals.  
2️⃣ **Fire Detection** - AI models process the data and identify potential fire hotspots.  
3️⃣ **Verification** - The system classifies whether the detected fire is due to stubble burning or another source.  
4️⃣ **Alert Generation** - Verified cases trigger instant notifications via SMS, email, and GIS mapping.  

## 🎯 Accuracy
📊 The system currently operates at **~70% accuracy**, with ongoing improvements based on more training data and model refinements.

## 🚧 Future Enhancements
🔹 **Improved AI accuracy** through additional training datasets  
🔹 **Integration with government policies** for enforcement and mitigation  
🔹 **Expansion to detect other wildfire incidents** beyond stubble burning  
🔹 **Farmer support programs**, including AI-optimized crop rotation and subsidy recommendations
